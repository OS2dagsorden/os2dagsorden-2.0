For installations where it is not possible to control the systems cron tab, Poormans cron makes sure, that cron is run every minute. On each request to the server, it checks if the Poormans service is running, and if not, it launches it. The poormans cron launcher is delegated to the <em>ultimate_cron_poorman</em> service host.
